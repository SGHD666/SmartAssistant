# System Architecture

## Overview

SmartAssistant is built on a modern, modular architecture that separates concerns and promotes maintainability. The system is divided into several key components:

```
SmartAssistant
├── SmartAssistant.Core        # Core business logic and services
├── SmartAssistant.UI         # User interface and presentation
└── SmartAssistant.Tests      # Test projects
```

## Core Components

### SmartAssistant.Core

The core library contains all business logic and services:

- **Task Execution System**
  - Task scheduling and management
  - Command execution pipeline
  - Error handling and recovery

- **LLM Services**
  - OpenAI integration
  - Claude integration
  - QianWen integration
  - Response processing

- **Automation Services**
  - System command execution
  - File system operations
  - Process management

### SmartAssistant.UI

The UI project uses Avalonia for cross-platform compatibility:

- **MVVM Architecture**
  - Views: XAML-based UI components
  - ViewModels: UI logic and state management
  - Models: Data structures and business objects

- **Value Converters**
  - Type conversion for UI binding
  - Format conversion for display
  - State-to-visual mapping

## Data Flow

1. **User Input Flow**
   ```
   User Input → UI → ViewModel → Core Services → LLM Processing → Task Execution
   ```

2. **Response Flow**
   ```
   Task Result → Core Services → ViewModel → UI Update → User Display
   ```

## Key Design Patterns

1. **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**
   - Separation of UI and business logic
   - Two-way data binding
   - Command pattern for user actions

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Service registration and lifecycle management
   - Interface-based programming
   - Testability and modularity

3. **Repository Pattern**
   - Data access abstraction
   - Centralized data operations
   - Caching and optimization

4. **Command Pattern**
   - Task encapsulation
   - Undo/Redo support
   - Operation queuing

## Security Architecture

1. **API Key Management**
   - Secure storage using .NET User Secrets
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Key rotation support

2. **Data Protection**
   - Local data encryption
   - Secure communication
   - Access control

## Error Handling

1. **Exception Hierarchy**
   - Custom exception types
   - Contextual error information
   - Recovery strategies

2. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Structured logging
   - Performance metrics
   - Diagnostic information

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Service-level testing
   - Mock-based isolation
   - High coverage targets

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Cross-component testing
   - Real service integration
   - End-to-end scenarios

## Future Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - Modular service architecture
   - Pluggable LLM providers
   - Extensible command system

2. **Performance**
   - Asynchronous operations
   - Resource optimization
   - Caching strategies
